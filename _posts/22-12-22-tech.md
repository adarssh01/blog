A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed database that stores a list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. Each block typically contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data.

Blockchains are widely known for their use in the cryptocurrency industry, where they are used to create and maintain a permanent, unchangeable record of transactions. However, blockchains have many other potential uses, including supply chain management, medical record keeping, and voting systems.

One of the key features of blockchains is that they are distributed across a network of computers, rather than being controlled by a single entity. This makes them resistant to tampering, as any attempt to alter the data on one computer would need to be reflected on all the other computers in the network. This distributed nature also makes blockchains particularly useful for applications where trust and transparency are important, as it allows multiple parties to verify and track the accuracy of the data.

Blockchains are created using complex algorithms and protocols that ensure
